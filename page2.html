                    <div class="col-md-8">
                        <p>The significant slowdown of all economies of the world and specially of the most vulnerable ones - as unemployment rates have risen, and COVID-19's economic impacts will be felt more - will make countries, especially food import-dependent countries, struggle to have the needed resources to buy food. In turn, as demand for food will decrease over the next months, prices should go down in 2020, and this will have a negative impact on farmers and the agricultural sector.</p>
                        <p>According to an FAO analysis (24 April), in the absence of timely and effective policies, millions more are likely to join the ranks of the hungry as a result of the COVID-19-triggered recession. That number will vary according to the severity of economic contractions, ranging from 14.4 million to 38.2 million, or even 80.3 million more hungry people should there be a contraction of 2, 5 or 10 percentage points, respectively, in all 101 net food-importing countries' GDP growth.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Countries significantly dependent on primary commodity exports (food, raw materials, fuels) are and will be affected by the significant reduction of demand from developed countries. For examples, countries in Africa can't export their produces (oil, cotton, for example) so their revenues will continue falling. Also, it has been harder for small islands and territories because tourism, their major source of revenue, has been closed down and will probably continue like this or significantly slow down until a vaccine or a treatment becomes available. Small islands and territories are also in many cases oil export-dependent. They also depend on remittances, which have been reduced by 20%, are vulnerable to climatic shocks, and depend on food imports.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-8">
                        <p>As of early May, the international prices of some major food staples, such as maize, wheat, and palm oil, have declined. The only staple food that has seen rising prices is rice, and that’s was linked to the export restrictions of a key exporter. Since the 1st of May the export quota of Vietnam has been removed and therefore the concerns over rice are now resolved. At local level, in markets, especially in countries already affected by hunger and other crises, some food commodity prices are increasing mainly because of local logistical problems or import difficulties.</p>
                        <p>in Syria, significant price increases (as much as 40-50 percent in food staples) and some shortages in basic goods have been reported since the middle of March. The price of vegetable seeds or other inputs that farmers need also rose. For example, pesticide prices recorded a 100 percent increase in Hama in April. The price of a pack of tomato seeds went up from $25 to $31 in mid-April in Homs. In Sudan, prices of staple foods increased sharply in March - over 10% - due to a further devaluation of the country’s currency, tight supplies as well as high production and transportation costs.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-8">
                        <p>At the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a significant increase in demand. Food demand is generally inelastic and its effect on overall consumption will be likely limited, although dietary patterns may alter. There is a possibility of a disproportionately larger decline in animal protein consumption (as a result of fears – not science-based – that animals might be hosts of the virus, and other higher-valued products like fish, fruits and vegetables (which are likely to cause price slumps). These fears can be particularly true for raw fish products supplied to restaurants and hotels, including small and medium enterprises.
                            <br>Following the outbreak of coronavirus, countries around the world started to implement a number of policy measures aimed at avoiding the further spread of the disease. However, such measures might affect agricultural production and trade. For instance, many countries are implementing higher controls on cargo vessels, with the risk of jeopardizing shipping activities and with a particular risk to perishable goods, like fresh fruits and vegetables, fish and fish products.

                    <div class="col-md-8">
                        <p>Fish and fish products that are highly dependent on international trade suffered quite early in the development of the pandemic from the restrictions and closures of global markets, whereas fresh fish and shellfish supply chains were severely impacted by the closure of the food service sectors (e.g. hotels, restaurants and catering facilities, including school and work canteens). The processing sector also faced closures due to reduced/lost consumer demand. 
                            This has had a significant impact, especially on women, who form the majority of the workforce in the post-harvest sector.
